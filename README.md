Data Science Project - Iris Dataset Analysis

Essay Insight
The essay emphasized how data science plays a critical role in transforming industries by uncovering insights and driving informed decisions. It highlighted the importance of combining **technical expertise** (statistics, programming, visualization) with **domain knowledge** to solve real-world problems. The insight gained is that data science is not just about numbers, but about **storytelling with data** to create value.

Dataset Analysis
For this project, the **Iris dataset** was analyzed.  
The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns:
- Sepal.Length (numeric)
- Sepal.Width (numeric)
- Petal.Length (numeric)
- Petal.Width (numeric)
- Species (categorical with 3 levels: setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Key Findings:
- **Mean Sepal Length**: ~5.84  
- **Median Sepal Length**: 5.80  
- **Variance of Sepal Length**: ~0.69  

Visualization:
Using **ggplot2**, a bar chart was created to compare the average Sepal Length across species. The results show that:
- *Virginica* generally has the longest sepals,
- *Setosa* has the shortest,
- *Versicolor* lies in between.  

This illustrates how visualization makes statistical differences clearer and more intuitive.

Chosen Role
The chosen role is **Data Scientist**.  
This role involves:
- Collecting and cleaning data,  
- Applying statistical and machine learning techniques,  
- Building visualizations to explain results,  
- Helping organizations make data-driven decisions.  

This project is a small demonstration of the kind of exploratory analysis a Data Scientist performs in real-world scenarios.
